    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Czzg1H9.jpg" alt="Crista" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
    <p>My name is Crista. I enjoy people watching. I love meeting new people and getting to know them and their thought
    process. When I was in grade school, I took a career test and it said I would be best fit in human services career,
    because of my love for humanity. I even attended some college and studied Sociology, continuing on that people path.
    But, I spent most of my life dedicated to people, I don't really know who I am. My hobbies and habits are aquired
    from friends, family members, and coworkers. There's nothing wrong with that, but I find myself always disclaiming
    any cool points for it being my original idea. This isn't a "woe is me" plea.
    This is my reason for attending a web developing bootcamp. Sure, my only background in html and css was designing my
    Xanga and Myspace pages, but Facebook took that away from me, so now I'm taking it back! This is who I want to
    become for me. Thanks for
    reading!</p>
